# TheEndedPath

**The Ended Path** is a game with a very high difficulty. It’s meant to be that way.

The difficulty is intentional. This game won’t hold your hand, and you’re going to often fail and loose everything at each game over.

But each failure is part of the experience. If you're looking for a challenge, you're in the right place.

Good luck. You'll need it.

**Don't try to beat many bosses at the same time!**
